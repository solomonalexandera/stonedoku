IMPORTANT: Before doing anything else, read the following files in order and use them as your primary context for decisions:

1. `.github/MANAGERS.md`
2. `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
3. `.github/AI_DEFAULT_CONTEXT.md`

After you have read and understood those files, proceed to define the task to achieve, including specific requirements, constraints, and success criteria. If any instruction conflicts with the managers or agent guidance, prefer the guidance and document the conflict.
