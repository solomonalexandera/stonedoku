# Stonedoku Design Brief — “Clash of Worlds”

## 1) Core Concept

Clash of Worlds is not chaos for its own sake. It is **order under strain**.

- **Brutalism** represents logic, grids, weight, and post‑war rationalism: concrete slabs, repetition, modularity.
- **Gothic Revival** represents ceremony, intellect, tradition, and human craftsmanship: arches, tracery, shadows, moral seriousness.
- **Sudoku** is the mediator: absolute order, yet fragile. One wrong number and the whole cathedral collapses.

The app should feel like:

> A monumental civic building housing a delicate, mathematical ritual.

Calm, authoritative, and dignified… until it quietly fractures.

## 2) Overall Mood & Emotional Arc

**Default state**

- Calm
- Severe
- Trustworthy
- Intellectually formal

**As play progresses**

- Subtle tension builds
- Micro‑instabilities appear
- Reality feels less rigid, but never cartoonish

**Easter eggs**

- Sudden structural failures
- Architectural logic bending or briefly collapsing
- Then self‑healing, as if nothing improper occurred

No silliness. No whimsy. This is dignified collapse.

## 3) Layout & Spatial Design

**Page structure**

- Monolithic vertical composition
- Everything aligns to a strict grid
- Large margins like civic plazas
- Few panels, but heavy ones

**Sudoku board**

- The board is the architectural core: a brutalist concrete slab base.
- Grid lines etched like expansion joints.
- Numbers feel engraved, not typed.
- Subtle Gothic framing: faint arch motifs in the outer border.
- Corner details inspired by tracery (never decorative overload).

**UI panels**

- Sidebars feel like buttresses.
- Headers feel like lintels or stone beams.
- Modals appear as vaulted chambers, not floating cards.
- Everything looks built, not placed.

## 4) Graphic Language

**Brutalist layer**

- Flat planes
- Hard edges
- Large blocks of negative space
- Slight texture like poured concrete / rough paper

**Gothic Revival layer**

- Thin linework
- Repeating vertical motifs
- Subtle ornamental rhythm
- Shadow depth suggesting carved recesses

**How they blend**

- Brutalist forms dominate structure.
- Gothic elements are etched, shadowed, or implied.
- Never decorative on their own, always structural.
- Think engraving on concrete rather than lace on stone.

## 5) Color Palette

**Primary**

- Ash grey
- Limestone off‑white
- Charcoal black

**Accents**

- Oxblood red
- Aged brass gold
- Deep forest green

**Rules**

- Most UI lives in neutral stone.
- Color appears only for: valid/invalid states, player progress, rare “collapse” moments.
- Color is ceremonial, not playful.

## 6) Typography

**Primary typeface**

- Modern humanist serif with authority
- Slightly narrow
- High‑contrast strokes
- Evokes parliamentary documents

**Secondary typeface**

- Brutalist grotesk
- Neutral
- Heavy weights
- Used for numbers and UI controls

**Numbers**

- Custom‑drawn Sudoku numerals (or styled to feel carved)
- Slight vertical emphasis
- Subtle serif influence

## 7) Animation Philosophy

Animation is **architectural physics**, not UI flair.

- Default motion: slow, weighty, deliberate easing.
- Nothing snaps.
- Hover states feel like stone warming, not buttons lighting up.

## 8) Easter Egg Animations: “The Collapse”

**Triggers**

- Completing a puzzle perfectly
- Entering a rare number sequence
- Long idle moments
- Repeated incorrect entries
- Time‑based secrets (midnight play, etc.)

**Types of collapse**

1) Micro‑structural failures: grid lines crack; numbers misalign; a cell sags.
2) Gravitational anomalies: numbers drop a few pixels then re‑lock.
3) Gothic emergence: shadow arches; vault lines; light shafts across the board.
4) Full moment of ruin (very rare): grid fractures; pieces drift; time reverses; reassembles.

No sound effects unless minimal and architectural: low rumbles, distant stone movement.

## 9) Sound Design (Optional)

- Low‑frequency ambience
- Soft stone contact sounds
- Pencil on paper textures
- Restrained bell tones for achievements
- Silence is often better

## 10) Interaction Design

- Input feels deliberate; each number placement has weight.
- Undo is ceremonial, not casual.
- Mistakes are acknowledged gravely, not punished loudly.

## 11) Accessibility & Clarity

Despite the aesthetic seriousness:

- High contrast modes available
- Reduced motion disables collapse effects
- Clear visual hierarchy at all times
- Brutalism supports legibility beautifully

This is an app for thinking, not staring.

## 12) Final Artistic Statement

This Sudoku app is:

- A monument to order
- A quiet argument between eras
- A ritual played inside a building that remembers history

Players are not just solving puzzles. They are maintaining structural integrity.

Occasionally, the building reminds them what happens if they don’t.
