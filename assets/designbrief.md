1. Core Concept

Clash of Worlds is not chaos for its own sake. It is order under strain.

Brutalism represents logic, grids, weight, and post-war rationalism. Concrete slabs, repetition, modularity.

Gothic Revival represents ceremony, intellect, tradition, and human craftsmanship. Arches, tracery, shadows, moral seriousness.

Sudoku is the perfect mediator: absolute order, yet fragile. One wrong number and the whole cathedral collapses.

The app should feel like:

A monumental civic building housing a delicate, mathematical ritual.

Calm, authoritative, and dignified… until it quietly fractures.

2. Overall Mood & Emotional Arc

Default state

Calm

Severe

Trustworthy

Intellectually formal

As play progresses

Subtle tension builds

Micro-instabilities appear

Reality feels less rigid, but never cartoonish

Easter eggs

Sudden structural failures

Architectural logic bending or briefly collapsing

Then self-healing, as if nothing improper occurred

No silliness. No whimsy. This is dignified collapse.

3. Layout & Spatial Design
Page Structure

Monolithic vertical composition

Everything aligns to a strict grid

Large margins like civic plazas

Few panels, but heavy ones

Sudoku Board

The board is the architectural core:

Brutalist concrete slab base

Grid lines etched like expansion joints

Numbers feel engraved, not typed

Subtle Gothic framing:

Faint arch motifs in the outer border

Corner details inspired by tracery, not decorative overload

UI Panels

Sidebars feel like buttresses

Headers feel like lintels or stone beams

Modals appear as vaulted chambers, not floating cards

Everything looks built, not placed.

4. Graphic Language
Brutalist Layer

Flat planes

Hard edges

Large blocks of negative space

Slight texture like poured concrete or rough paper

Gothic Revival Layer

Thin linework

Repeating vertical motifs

Subtle ornamental rhythm

Shadow depth suggesting carved recesses

How They Blend

Brutalist forms dominate structure

Gothic elements are etched, shadowed, or implied

Never decorative on their own, always structural

Think engraving on concrete rather than lace on stone.

5. Color Palette
Primary

Ash grey

Limestone off-white

Charcoal black

Accents

Oxblood red

Aged brass gold

Deep forest green

Rules

Most of the UI lives in neutral stone

Color only appears for:

Valid/invalid states

Player progress

Easter egg moments

Color is ceremonial, not playful.

6. Typography
Primary Typeface

A modern humanist serif with authority

Slightly narrow

High contrast strokes

Evokes parliamentary documents

Secondary Typeface

Brutalist grotesk

Neutral

Heavy weights

Used for numbers and UI controls

Numbers

Custom-drawn Sudoku numerals

Slight vertical emphasis

Subtle serif influence

Feels carved, not printed

7. Animation Philosophy

Animation is architectural physics, not UI flair.

Default Motion

Slow

Weighty

Deliberate easing

Nothing snaps

Hover states feel like stone warming, not buttons lighting up.

8. Easter Egg Animations: “The Collapse”

This is where the worlds truly clash.

Triggers

Completing a puzzle perfectly

Entering a rare number sequence

Long idle moments

Repeated incorrect entries

Time-based secrets (midnight play, etc.)

Types of Collapse
1. Micro-Structural Failures

Grid lines subtly crack

Numbers briefly misalign

A cell sags as if under weight

2. Gravitational Anomalies

Numbers fall downward by a few pixels

Then re-lock into place

As if gravity briefly changed its mind

3. Gothic Emergence

Shadow arches briefly appear behind the grid

Vault lines animate in and out

Light shafts cut across the board

4. Full Moment of Ruin (Very Rare)

The grid fractures

Pieces drift apart in silence

Then reverse in time and reassemble perfectly

No sound effects unless minimal and architectural: low rumbles, distant stone movement.

9. Sound Design (Optional but Powerful)

Low-frequency ambience

Soft stone contact sounds

Pencil on paper textures

Very restrained bell tones for achievements

Silence is often better.

10. Interaction Design

Input feels deliberate

Each number placement has weight

Undo is ceremonial, not casual

Mistakes are not punished loudly.
They are acknowledged gravely.

11. Accessibility & Clarity

Despite the aesthetic seriousness:

High contrast modes available

Reduced motion mode disables collapse effects

Clear visual hierarchy at all times

Brutalism supports legibility beautifully

This is an app for thinking, not staring.

12. Final Artistic Statement

This Sudoku app is:

A monument to order

A quiet argument between eras

A ritual played inside a building that remembers history

Players are not just solving puzzles.
They are maintaining structural integrity.

Occasionally, the building reminds them what happens if they don’t.
