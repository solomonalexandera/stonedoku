      "prompt": "A high-resolution, photorealistic stone wall background inspired by the Houses of Parliament in London, blending restrained Gothic Revival civic architecture with post-war British brutalism.\n\nThe surface is composed of large limestone and concrete panels with subtle expansion joints and structural seams. Fine stone grain, gentle pitting, faint stains, and light soot accumulation are visible.\n\nLighting is calm and diffuse, as if under an overcast London sky. No hard shadows, no dramatic highlights, no directional spotlighting.\n\nArchitectural presence is implied through soft tonal shifts only, with no literal arches, carvings, or interior cathedral features.\n\nColor palette is neutral limestone, ash gray, and muted warm stone tones. No strong color cast.\n\nContrast is restrained and even, with approximately 8–12% tonal variance across the frame to avoid banding.\n\nThe image should feel cinematic, dignified, and monumental, suitable as a UI environment background.\n\nNo text, no people, no props, no fantasy elements.\n\nHigh spatial detail, realistic material texture, no painterly smoothing, designed to be upscaled later.\n\nNegative: no neon or saturated colors, no dramatic lighting, no cathedral interiors, no fantasy, no text or symbols, no people.\n\nReduce visual drama. Flatten lighting. Remove theatrical mood. This is civic and restrained, not religious or cinematic fantasy."

Structural panel seams remain visible but understated.\n\nLighting remains soft and diffuse, with marginally deeper shadow pooling toward the edges of the frame.\n\nNeutral ash, limestone, and charcoal tones only. Avoid cool blue or warm yellow casts.\n\nGentle contrast, smooth tonal transitions, no banding, no sharp highlights.\n\nCalm, civic, and architectural rather than dramatic.\n\nHigh spatial detail, realistic material texture, no painterly smoothing, designed to be upscaled later.\n\nNegative: no neon or saturated colors, no dramatic lighting, no cathedral interiors, no fantasy, no text or symbols, no people.\n\nReduce visual drama.
