# Creative Direction — Stonedoku “Clash of Worlds”
Source brief: DESIGN_BRIEF.md

## Pillars
- Monumental calm: brutalist slabs, civic-scale spacing, carved typography.
- Gothic intellect: implied arches, tracery lines, shadowed recesses; never ornamental fluff.
- Order under strain: everything aligns to a strict grid; micro-fractures appear under pressure.

## Visual System
- Layout: monolithic vertical stack; few heavy panels (board as core slab, side buttresses for meta info).
- Palette: stone neutrals (ash/limestone/charcoal) with ceremonial accents only (oxblood for errors, aged brass for highlights, deep forest green for chat/valid).
- Type: humanist serif for headlines (authoritative, narrow), brutalist grotesk for UI and numerals. Numbers styled like engraved glyphs.
- Surfaces: flat planes with subtle concrete/paper texture; hard edges; carved shadows instead of glows.
- Borders & lines: etched/engraved strokes; expansion-joint grid lines; faint arch motifs framing the board.

## Interaction Tone
- Deliberate, weighted inputs; undo/erase feel costly.
- Feedback is grave, not playful. Mistakes acknowledged with subdued strain.
- Color is earned: only for state (valid/invalid/progress) and rare “collapse” moments.
- Accessibility-first: high contrast, reduced-motion path that disables collapse effects.

## Motion Language
- Slow, weighty easing; nothing snaps. Hover warms stone rather than lights up.
- Collapse easter eggs: cracks, sagging cells, gravitational dips, shadow arches emerging then self-healing.
- Reduced-motion: fall back to opacity/transform-less fades.

## Sound (optional but aligned)
- Low rumbles, distant stone shifts, pencil-on-paper; no bright UI beeps. Silence acceptable by default.
